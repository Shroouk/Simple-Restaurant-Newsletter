building a newsletter designed with LESS

using media query to make the page responsive

Use with Node.js: 

`npm install -g less`

Or the browser:
```
<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.less" />
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/less@3.13" ></script>
```

If you add a folder to WinLess (either via 'Add folder' or by dropping it on the folder pane), WinLess will start watching the LESS files in it. WinLess will automatically recompile a LESS file when it is changed
